# Resume
This repository contains my academic and business CVs. The academic 3-color and business CVs derive from [Awesome CV](https://github.com/posquit0/Awesome-CV). For the academic version, I stripped out some color and presentation, and changed some of the structure to match academic standards. The academic plain version is a simple one written in LibreOffice.
